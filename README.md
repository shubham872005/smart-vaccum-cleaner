# smart-vaccum-cleaner
The Smart Vacuum Cleaner is an AI-powered simulation (or hardware prototype) that autonomously navigates and cleans an environment efficiently. 

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Sensor-based automation can be combined to create a smart home device capable of perceiving its surroundings and making decisions in real-time.

⚙️ Features

🤖 Autonomous Navigation – Automatically moves through the environment without human control.

🧭 Obstacle Detection – Uses sensors (or simulated logic) to detect and avoid walls and objects.

🧼 Smart Cleaning Algorithm – Optimized path planning ensures efficient area coverage.

🔁 Dynamic Environment Handling – Responds to changes (e.g., new obstacles or dirty tiles).

💡 User Interface (optional) – Simple GUI to visualize the vacuum’s movement and environment (Tkinter/Pygame).

📊 Performance Metrics – Tracks cleaned areas, battery usage, and time taken.
